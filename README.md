## SMS Butler

A basic Android app which can respond to incoming SMS messages with another message of your choosing.

Keep a stable of stock messages to choose from and quickly enable/disable automatic replying.

## Why?

I wanted to play around with responding to SMS messages and I also wanted to play around with RecyclerView and Realm.IO which I use for message
persistence.
